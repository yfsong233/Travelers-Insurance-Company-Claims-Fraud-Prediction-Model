Kaggle Competition: 2023 Travelers NESS Statathon

This repository contains the analysis and modeling work for the competition hosted on Kaggle. The goal of this competition was to analyze travel data and derive insights using statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The **2023 Traveler's Ness Statathon** challenges participants to develop statistical models and insights that can help improve the travel experience. 

## Data

The provided datasets include information on travel patterns, preferences, demographics, and other features. The analysis focuses on understanding key factors that influence travel behavior and developing predictive models for travel-related metrics.

## Analysis Workflow

The analysis is organized into the following steps:

1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**: Load the data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the data using visualizations and summary statistics to understand the distribution of variables and their relationships.
3. **Modeling**: Develop statistical and machine learning models to predict key outcomes. The models may include linear regression, k-means clusering, decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, and other supervised machine learning algorithms.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics like RMSE, MAE, or accuracy.
5. **Results and Insights**: Summarize the findings and provide actionable insights derived from the analysis.

## Requirements

- R (version >= 4.0)
- R packages: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `caret`, `randomForest`, `rmarkdown`, etc.
